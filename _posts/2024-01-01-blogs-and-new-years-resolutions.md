Attempting to motivate myself to actually keep notes on things that I find
interesting in a more organized fashion.

<!--more-->

As 2024 hits, I realized that, like many people, I keep meaning to buckle down
and stop losing random tidbits that I've picked up along the way. And, like most
people, I keep not doing it :-D.

So, in the time honored tradition of creating New Year resolutions that I
vaguely mean to keep rolling, I will now attempt to ramble on about some form of
nonsense at least once a month.

Absolutely no guarantees that the content will be interesting, relevant,
gramattically correct, or even coherent...but you have to start somewhere
:upside_down_face:.
