  bio: |
    Automating compliance for fun and...mostly for fun.

    Over the last couple of decades, I've done everything from large-scale
    compliance automation to helping to start a company as well as professional
    consulting.

    My primary focus is on DevSecOps and the surrounding ecosystem but I
    happily dabble in anything from business process automation to federal
    policy ontology mappings.
